Although you can technically push changes to and pull changes from individuals' repositories,
 doing so is discouraged because you can fairly easily confuse what they’re working on if you’re not careful.

A remote repository is generally a bare repository — a Git repository that has no working directory.

a bare repository is the contents of your project’s .git directory and nothing else

Git can use four distinct protocols to transfer data: Local, HTTP, Secure Shell (SSH) and Git

Local Protocol
 if everyone on your team has access to a shared filesystem such as an NFS mount, 
or in the less likely case that everyone logs in to the same computer

If you have a shared mounted filesystem, then you can clone, push to, and pull from a local file-based repository.

to clone a local repository, you can run something like this:

git clone /srv/git/project.git
or
git clone file:///srv/git/project.git

To add a local repository to an existing Git project, you can run something like this:
git remote add local_proj /srv/git/project.git

Then, you can push to and pull from that remote via your new remote name local_proj as though you were doing so over a network.

Pros:
simple and uses exisiting file permissions and network access
