branch early and often

If making a new branch:

newImage
master *

on commit, master * moves forward since it is the currently selected branch

git checkout <branch> selects which branch to control.

git checkout -b <branchName> to create a new branch and switch to it.

git merge creates a special commit that has two unique parents

Rebasing essentially takes a set of commits, "copies" them, and plops them down somewhere else.

Rebasing makes a linear sequence of commits. Log and history will be cleaner if used.
